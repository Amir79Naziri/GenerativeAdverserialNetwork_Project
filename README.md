## About The Project
This project implements `generative-adverserial neural networks` with `PyTorch` and uses the `MNIST` and `AnimeFace` dataset for a training and testing model. 


## Phases  

<h3 id="Phase1">Implement Model for MNIST dataset</h3>  

In this phase networks are designed for `MNIST` dataset. All further information about architecture of models and results are saved in the notebook.

<h3 id="Phase2">Implement Model for AnimeFace dataset</h3>  
  
In this phase networks are designed for `AnimeFace` dataset. All further information about architecture of models and results are saved in the notebook.
